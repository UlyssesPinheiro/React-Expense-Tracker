# Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker built with React, during the course "React - The Complete Guide
(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" on Udemy

# How it works

Simply add new expenses with the "add new expense" button. Then you can filter
the expenses by year, and see the entire year in a graph month by month.
